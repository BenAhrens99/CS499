				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			</header>
			<p>Hello, my name is Benjamin Ahrens and this page is here to show how I've improved during my stay at SNHU
				these past 3 years. Below you will see many improvements to a application I started before attending
				SNHU that I simply called Warframe Price Checker. The
				application uses Tesseract, an open source OCR to detect rewards on the screen, http requests to
				warframe.market to pull recent order information on each item and display the current price those items
				go for. I included this artifact in my portfolio because I believe there is a lot I can do to improve
				this project since I made it so long ago and left it bare bones and wanted to use this opportunity to
				improve it with the knowledge I acquired at SNHU.</p>

				My time at SNHU more than anything helped improve my ability to collaborate in a team environment,
				before
				attending SNHU I only created coding projects for myself and they had a wide range of technical debt.
				During
				the course of this class I went back and updated one of those old projects to fit my current coding
				style
				which is much easier to work with. In the same project I’ve enhanced it to have a more efficient and
				secure
				database than what was previously used. I've also come to believe that the most critical phase of
				software
				development is the initial one: defining requirements through collaboration between stakeholders,
				programmers, and end-users. This class has sharpened that belief by focusing on stakeholder
				communication.
				On a related note, team collaboration has shown me how this same principle of external input applies to
				my
				own work. I often become too immersed in a project to see it objectively, and a fresh perspective from a
				teammate is invaluable for spotting hidden mistakes and suggesting improvements.

				<h2>Artifact 1: Software Engineering and Design</h2>
			</header>
			<p>The enhancement that was done was a full rewriting of the application in java. The Java stack I used is
				Maven for project management, Tess4J for the OCR when reading the rewards on screen, and Java’s built in
				http client and JSON Parser to request the JSON data from warframe.market, both for the total item list
				and gathering price data. The biggest improvement made with rewriting the project would be the
				readability of the code and reduced technical debt. While the codebase is fairly small still the python
				code was fairly rushed and just focused on getting it working. When going back and rewriting it I made
				sure to break up the processes into smaller methods, named variables more clearly and added comments at
				places where it isn’t very clear why something is done that way. As for technical improvements,
				capturing the screen and reading rewards was heavily improved. I used Java’s robots to capture
				specifically warframe and only record where the reward text would be. This was done fairly easily by
				using a percentage of the overall screen region to locate the reward text, the UI in warframe scales the
				exact same way so it now works with any resolution the game provides. Adjustments to the OCR
				configuration were also made, adjusting the dpi to fit more accurately with the screen region that is
				provided, this allowed for more accurate text readings from Tess4J when before it wasn’t functioning
				very well on lower resolutions.I believe I did meet the course outcomes I planned in module one, the
				only outcome I was looking to meet was demonstrating the ability to use well-founded and innovative
				techniques, skills and tools for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and
				accomplish industry-specific goals. This was shown through the usage of Tess4J and optimizing it further
				for my use case. Another outcome I met with this enhancement would be employing strategies for building
				collaborative environments. With the code I wrote it was designed to be much more readable than its
				counterpart and people should have a much easier time understanding what is going on.</p>
			<p> I had many issues when trying to rewrite this artifact in a whole different language. Switching from
				Python to Java ended up using many different tools, with some being easier to implement and others much
				harder while the only one staying the same being Tess4J. Capturing a screen region through Java’s robot
				class eliminated the need for OpenCV and allowed for a much more efficient way of reading the screen and
				less dependencies. Some challenges I faced when changing to Java was the change to a statically typed
				language, this made reading the JSON files pulled from warframe.markets API a bit harder to read. OpenCV
				also didn’t have the same functionality as it did in their python package so I had to switch to a
				different class, this ended up being for the better but required more research on what I should use.</p>

				<h2>Artifact 2: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
			</header>
			<p>The enhancement that was done this time was lessening the load on warframe.markets API, reducing the
				number of calls significantly to their API and storing pricing information in a MongoDB database. This
				comes at the cost of data freshness as taking from the API directly would be more accurate but it would
				take much longer to get the pricing information. I also changed from permanently capturing the screen to
				user inputted screen capture to not take as many resources. While these enhancements are fairly small
				they are a key move to increase performance and get item prices to the user as soon as possible. This
				change to the screen capture ended up being the most efficient way to handle it, allowing the user to
				see the prices when they want to and not popping up every time they get on a reward screen but only when
				they are uncertain about the values. I’m not going to talk too much about the database as it was just to
				allow for less API calls and will be fleshed out during the next enhancement.
				I ended up meeting one of the course outcomes I planned to meet with this enhancement from module one,
				meeting only one isn’t an issue here as I already met the first of the two in enhancement one. The
				second planned enhancement was “Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using
				algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while
				managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.” I believe this was met when focusing on the
				trade-off between data freshness and speed, speed is much more important in this program as you are only
				given a small amount of time to pick which reward you want. This makes it worth sacrificing some data
				freshness to allow the user to have a more thought out decision before it disappears. The screen not
				recording all the time but only when the user wants a screenshot will also be very beneficial to lower
				end devices, not taking away as much resources while the program is running. </p>
			<p>
				When improving the artifact I learned a few things that made it impossible to achieve my old goal.
				Looking further into warframe.markets API they do not have a batch endpoint that I would be able to use
				to get around the 3 requests per second limit. Because of this I decided to create a barebones version
				of the database earlier than expected so it can reduce the strain on warframe.market’s API. While I
				didn’t run into any issues when implementing an event-driven capture method with the current state of
				the application just allowing the user to pick when they want to show the reward prices ended up feeling
				much better, this might end up becoming a toggleable feature in the future but isn’t in the application
				at the moment.

				<h2>Artifact 3: Databases</h2>
			</header>
			<p>These enhancements were all about securing the database and providing a schema for the data being
				entered. As mentioned in artifact two I moved from a CSV file to mongoDB, since I can rebuild the
				database fairly quickly due to the small amount of items on warframe.market there was no need to migrate
				any data and I could just create a new method to build it from scratch. The first thing I did after
				moving the data was create a schema within my mongo database setting the required parameters for each
				entry and the data type they would be. The only information we are storing in this database is
				information on prime parts opened from relics. This is fairly simple to add as I have already defined
				all these variables as an object in my Java project. Each item will have its name as a string, its url
				for the warframe.market API as a string, the currently stored price of the item as a double and the last
				updated date as a date. The reason the price is a double instead of an int when warframe.market only
				trades in whole values is because we are averaging the lowest 5 prices in warframe.market. The biggest
				reason for my use of mongoDB over a relational database is to plan for the future, with the addition of
				new items or new features. Being able to adjust the schema as needed will be essential to a more rapidly
				changing environment as nothing I’ve done so far is guaranteed to stay the same. There was no real
				issues with this enhancement, the data was very easy to handle and the schema was already set when
				making it a java object. With this the last course outcome of developing a security mindset that
				mitigates design flaws would be met.</p>
